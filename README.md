## Set up and getting it running
1. First, clone this project.
2. Open your favourite IDE, if you are using IntelliJ, just click the file build.gradle and choose: "Open as project":

Make sure you have JDK installed in your machine. If not I recommend using [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).

And then, add it to IDE:
